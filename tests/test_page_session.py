"""`duet page` as part of a session, not as a command you type.

The three joins between a page check and the rest of duet: the gate a website
gets detected for it, the page rules counting as that website's test suite, and
the prompt that tells both agents to look at the screenshots. A website session
is exactly as good as these — a page check nobody runs is a script in a
repository, not a gate.

Nothing here imports `duet.page` or `duet.chrome`, and that is deliberate: every
case below is a claim about behaviour reachable through duet's long-standing
surface — `gate.detect`, `workflows.test_files`, `prompts.turn_prompt`, an
Orchestrator run — so against the code as it was before this feature each one
fails on what it asserts rather than on a module that is not there yet. duet's
own replay says an import error proves the test needs the new code, not that it
checks anything; these do not lean on one. The filename `duet-page.json` is
spelled out for the same reason.
