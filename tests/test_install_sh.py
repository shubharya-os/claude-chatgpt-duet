It is piped straight into `sh` on a machine we have never seen, so two things
have to hold: it must parse under whatever `sh` is there (dash on Debian,
busybox on Alpine — not bash), and it must not report an install it has not
got. Both are checked by running it, because reading it is what missed the
last four of these.
