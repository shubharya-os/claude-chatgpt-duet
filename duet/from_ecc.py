"""`duet from-ecc`: find out what you actually use from ECC before you switch.

The hard part of leaving a large harness is not installing the new one, it is
not knowing what you would lose. So this reads your own Claude Code session
logs — locally, nothing leaves the machine — and counts which ECC agents,
skills and commands were really invoked, and where. On the machine it was
built on, that answer was two agents out of 454 skills and agents — one of which
the hand-run audit it replaces had missed — and everything else had never
been called.

It also keeps what you use: `--keep NAME` copies that one agent or skill out
of ECC's plugin cache into your own Claude Code directory, licence notice
included, so removing the plugin does not break the project that relied on it.

It never uninstalls ECC. It prints the command, and you run it.
