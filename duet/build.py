"""Starting a project from nothing.

A greenfield directory is where duet used to lose its own mechanism: no tests
exist, so gate detection finds nothing, and the session header reads "gate:
none — they can only agree by argument". That is also exactly where people
build fastest and ship worst.

So a build session sets the gate to the project's test command from round one,
before a single test exists. It is red until the pair writes real tests that
pass, and a red gate blocks both sign-offs. Having nothing to verify against
becomes the thing that stops them finishing, instead of the thing nobody
noticed.

The hard part is not choosing a command, it is refusing to choose a *flattering*
one. Three of the obvious candidates pass an empty directory — `unittest
discover` before Python 3.12, `go test ./...`, `cargo test` — and a gate that
goes green on nothing is a false proof, which is the one thing the double
sign-off exists to rule out. So whatever is chosen is run once before the
session starts, and a gate that is already green on a workspace with no tests
is refused rather than used.

TASK = """\
Build this, from nothing, in this directory:

%(idea)s

Work in this order. Do not skip ahead.

1. AGREE WHAT DONE MEANS. Before any implementation, settle the acceptance
   criteria with your peer: concrete, checkable statements about behaviour,
   including the unhappy paths — bad input, a missing file, the empty case.
   Write them to ACCEPTANCE.md. Disagreeing now is cheap; after the code
   exists it is not.

   Name the environment those criteria assume — language runtime and lowest
   supported version, OS, anything that must already be installed. The gate
   runs one command, on one machine, with one interpreter, so whatever the
   criteria leave unstated is what nothing will check. A previous session
   ended in agreement on a CLI that crashed on the older interpreter neither
   agent had thought to name.

   Write down the defaults too, especially the ones with consequences: what it
   binds to, what it writes and where, what it exposes, what it keeps. Another
   session shipped a service listening on 0.0.0.0 — not because either agent
   argued for it, but because neither mentioned it, and an unstated default is
   the one thing neither the gate nor your peer can object to.

2. WRITE THE TESTS FIRST, and watch them fail. Encode every criterion from
   ACCEPTANCE.md as a test. The gate already runs them, so it is red until
   they exist and pass, and neither of you can sign off while it is red. A
   test that cannot fail is worse than no test: it looks like proof and is
   not, so check each one fails before you make it pass.

   The gate is exactly this, run from the root of this directory:

       %(gate)s

   Your tests have to be the ones that command runs. If it is the wrong
   command for what you are building, say so on your first turn — do not
   quietly build something it cannot see.

3. THEN BUILD, until the gate is green.

4. CHECK WHAT YOU BUILT against the criteria you agreed in step 1, not
   against your memory of the task.

5. LEAVE A WAY IN. Write README.md with a section headed "How to run it" whose
   first code block is the exact command that starts or uses what you built,
   runnable from this directory as it stands. The person who asked for this
   has not read your code; that command is the first thing they will try.

The ordinary rules still apply: answer every objection your peer raises, and
vote DONE only if you would ship exactly what is in the workspace now."""
