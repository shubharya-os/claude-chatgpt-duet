"""Workflows: what ECC asks an agent to do, checked instead of asked.

Every orchestrated workflow in the agent-harness world is a prompt. "Write a
failing test first." "Do not change behaviour." "Only plan, do not build." The
agent is told the rule and trusted to follow it, and a single agent grading
its own homework will report that it did.

duet has two things a prompt does not: a harness that runs the gate itself,
and a veto over consensus. So each workflow here states its rule to the pair
*and* checks it against what actually happened — the gate's history and the
files on disk. When the check fails, the sign-offs are cleared and both agents
are told exactly which rule was broken. Neither of them can talk past it,
because neither of them is the one checking.

What each can and cannot prove is written next to it. None of these makes two
models incapable of being wrong together; each closes one specific way of
declaring done without having done it.
