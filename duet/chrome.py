"""Driving a real browser with nothing but the standard library.

A website usually has no test command, so a duet session on one has no gate —
two models agreeing by argument about CSS neither of them has seen rendered.
This is the half of the answer that talks to Chrome: find it, start it headless
on a throwaway profile, speak the DevTools protocol over a pipe, and always
kill it again. What to *check* once a page is rendered lives in page.py.

Why a pipe and not a websocket: `--remote-debugging-pipe` hands Chrome file
descriptors 3 and 4 and speaks the same protocol over them, NUL-terminated,
which json and os.read can do between them. `--remote-debugging-port` would
mean a websocket client, which the standard library does not have.

Every flag here is the answer to something observed rather than a precaution:

- Headless Chrome will not make a window narrower than 500px, so a phone width
  cannot be a window size. `Emulation.setDeviceMetricsOverride` sets the exact
  viewport instead, and is the only reason this drives the protocol at all.
- A fresh profile on macOS can block on a Keychain prompt that headless Chrome
  never shows anyone: `--use-mock-keychain --password-store=basic`. The profile
  is always a throwaway directory, so nobody's real browser is ever touched.
- Pages that fetch from other hosts stall or flake, and a flaky gate is worse
  than no gate: every outside host is mapped to nothing unless the caller opts
  out for a page served from a local dev server.
- duet runs gates with a minimal PATH, so Chrome is looked for in the places it
  is actually installed as well as on PATH — and not finding it is reported as
  a setup fault, never as a fault in the page.
- `os.killpg` is the right cleanup, because Chrome's helper processes live in
  its process group. Under duet's own agent sandbox it raises EPERM, so the
  group is attempted, the child is killed regardless, and teardown never raises
  on a run that already produced its answer.
