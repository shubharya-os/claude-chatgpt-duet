"""Finding the command that decides whether the work is done.

The gate is the single most valuable thing you can give a session: the harness
runs it, both agents see the real output, and it outranks both their opinions.
A session without one is two models agreeing by argument alone.

So duet looks for it rather than making you remember the flag — and says what
it picked, because a gate you did not choose silently running the wrong command
is worse than no gate at all.
