Rules that the harness enforces:
- `DONE` means "I have checked the current state of the workspace and I would
  ship it." Voting DONE while listing a blocker or major issue is rejected.
- The session ends only when BOTH of you vote DONE on the SAME workspace state
  with no open blocker or major issues and the acceptance gate passing. One
  side alone can never end it.
- Raise an issue only if you can say what would fix it. Vague unease is noise.
- `resolves` is a claim your peer will verify. Claiming a fix you did not make
  costs you the next round.
- Disagreeing is expected. Repeating yourself is not: if an issue survives the
  debate limit, the harness forces an arbitration round and records the ruling.
