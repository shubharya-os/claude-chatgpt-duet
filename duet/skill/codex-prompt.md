description: Hand this to ChatGPT and Claude Code together — they build it and check each other until both sign off
argument-hint: <what you want built> | running | review
---

The user typed `/duet $ARGUMENTS` (if that placeholder is not substituted, use whatever
text followed the command).

## If the argument is `running` or `status`

Run `{{DUET}} status` and report it in one short paragraph: still going or finished, which
round, who it is waiting on, what they are arguing about, whether the gate passes. Do not
start a new session.

## If the argument is `review`

Run `duet review --reviewer claude` to get Claude
Code's opinion on the current diff. Report the findings and say which you agree with.
You may disagree — say so and why.

## Otherwise — hand the work over

The user has been talking to you and should not have to repeat any of it.

**1. Write the handoff note** to `/tmp/duet-context.md`: what the user is trying to
achieve in their words, decisions already made and ruled out, constraints they stated,
what you already tried and what happened, and which files matter. Short and specific —
this goes to two engineers who cannot see this conversation. Omit anything you are unsure
of.

**2. The gate** — duet finds the project's test command itself and says what it picked.
Pass `--gate` only to override it. If it found none, say so: "done" is then just two
models agreeing.

**3. Run it:**

```bash
{{DUET}} run "$ARGUMENTS" --context-file /tmp/duet-context.md --pair codex+claude
```

If the workspace is empty — no source, no tests, nothing to detect — use `build`
instead. It sets the gate before any code exists, so it starts red, and orders the work:
acceptance criteria first, failing tests second, implementation third.

```bash
{{DUET}} build "$ARGUMENTS" --context-file /tmp/duet-context.md --pair codex+claude
```

**Pick the command by what the user is asking for** — each one holds the pair to a
rule the harness checks, so the right one matters more than the wording:

| the user wants to… | run | what the harness refuses to accept |
|---|---|---|
| build something new in an empty directory | `build` | a gate that is green before any code exists |
| fix a bug | `fix` | tests that would have passed on the buggy code too |
| add a feature to an existing project | `add` | tests that would have passed without the feature |
| restructure without changing behaviour | `refactor` | any edit to an existing test; a suite red at the start |
| decide how to do something, not do it | `plan` | any change except `PLAN.md` |
| anything else | `run` | — |

```bash
{{DUET}} fix "$ARGUMENTS" --context-file /tmp/duet-context.md --pair codex+claude
```

`fix`, `add` and `refactor` need the project's test command; if duet cannot find one,
it says so and stops, and you should pass `--gate`. Tell the user which rule the
session was held to when you report back — "both agreed, and the tests were replayed
against the original code and caught the bug" is a stronger claim than "both agreed".


`--pair codex+claude` puts you (ChatGPT) in the lead and Claude Code as reviewer, which
matches the conversation the user is already in. Use `claude+codex` if they would rather
Claude lead.

**4. Report back properly.** Whether both signed off and on what; what actually changed,
read from the diff rather than relayed; the disagreement and how it resolved (see
`{{DUET}} report`); and your own view. If they agreed on something you think is wrong, say
so — you are the third opinion, not a courier.

## Rules

- Never run this over uncommitted work the user cares about without saying so first —
  both agents edit the workspace. Offer a branch.
- Do not re-run to get a nicer answer. Fix what was raised.
- If a side is not signed in, run `{{DUET}} doctor` and hand the user the fix it prints.
