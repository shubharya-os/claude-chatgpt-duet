# QA record

What has actually been run, on real machines, against real agents — and what has
not. Anything below marked *live* was executed end to end; anything marked
*stubbed* is covered by tests against a fake binary or a fake API, which is weaker
evidence and is labelled as such.

## Automated suite

70 tests, no network and no credentials required. `pytest -q` from a clean clone.

| area | what is pinned |
|---|---|
| envelope parsing | fenced / bare / prose-only replies, example-before-real, verdict and severity synonyms, garbage confidence, duplicate issue ids |
| the two hard rules | a reply with no envelope is `CONTINUE`; `DONE` beside a blocker is downgraded |
| consensus | a lone `DONE` never finishes; a sign-off dies when the workspace changes; a failing gate overrides both agents; an open blocker overrides both agents |
| issue lifecycle | claimed-fixed is not fixed; the raiser accepting closes it; the raiser re-raising reopens it; an agent may withdraw its own |
| deadlock | a circular argument reaches arbitration and the ruling settles it; a stall is detected |
| workspace | state ids are deterministic and ignore `.duet`; patches apply, delete, no-op; paths escaping the workspace, `.git/` or `.duet/` are refused |
| git manners | rendering a diff does not stage the user's files |
| orchestration | happy path, lone-yes, gate veto, arbitration, missing envelope, patch escape, backend outage, either side leading, peer words reaching the peer verbatim |
| adapters | exact flags passed to `claude` and `codex`, session resume, stream-vs-object output, plain-text fallback, signed-out detection, no inherited stdin, last-message file preferred over scraped stdout |
| plumbing | session files written; piped runs stream instead of block-buffering |

## Live runs

| check | result |
|---|---|
| **ChatGPT side, end to end** *(live)* | A full duet session with the real Codex CLI as one peer, signed in with a ChatGPT account. It built the file, answered the reviewer's objection, used `resolves` correctly, and both sides signed off on the same state. `parse_ok=True` on every turn — a real model complied with the envelope format unprompted. |
| **ChatGPT sign-in** *(live)* | `codex login status` → "Logged in using ChatGPT". No API key present in `~/.codex/auth.json`. |
| **Claude sign-in detection** *(live)* | `claude auth status` correctly reported a signed-out CLI, and `duet doctor` refused to call itself ready. |
| **Install** *(live)* | Fresh clone → `pip install .` → `duet demo` on Python 3.9 / pip 21.2 / setuptools 58, and on 3.12. CI covers 3.9, 3.11 and 3.13. |
| **Claude side, end to end** | **Not yet run.** It needs an interactive `claude auth login`, which only the account holder can complete. The adapter's flags and parsing are pinned by stubbed tests; the live round trip is still outstanding. |

## Bugs the live runs found

These are the reason the live runs were worth doing — none of them could have been
caught by the stubbed suite alone.

1. **A signed-out CLI reported as ready.** The probe ran `claude --version`, which
   succeeds whether or not you are signed in, so `duet doctor` said ready and the
   session then failed on its first turn. Probes now ask `claude auth status` and
   `codex login status` for the real state.
2. **`codex exec` hung forever on an inherited stdin pipe.** It appends piped stdin
   to the prompt, so it waited for an EOF that never came. A live session sat idle
   for eleven minutes on turn one. Both adapters now pass `stdin=DEVNULL`.
3. **Piped runs looked frozen.** Reporter output block-buffered as soon as stdout
   was not a terminal, so nothing appeared until the session ended. stdout is now
   line-buffered and every reporter line flushes.
4. **A nicer diff was staging the user's files.** `diff()` ran `git add -AN` so new
   files would show up, quietly changing the index of a repo duet is a guest in.
   New files are now listed from `git status` instead.
5. **The entry point vanished on old pip.** `pip install -e .` on pip < 21.3
   installed the package with no `duet` command and reported success. `pip install .`
   is now the documented path, a `setup.py` shim covers the legacy case, and CI
   asserts a plain install yields a working command.
6. **`duet demo` left its report where nobody would look.** It runs in a temp
   workspace, so a following `duet report` found nothing. The demo now prints the
   exact command to read its own transcript.

## Known gaps

- The full two-agent live session is pending the Claude sign-in described above.
- Codex session continuity (`codex exec resume --last`) is best-effort. Every prompt
  duet builds is self-contained, so a dropped session costs context, not correctness.
- Two models can still be wrong together. The double sign-off raises the floor; the
  acceptance gate is what keeps it honest.
